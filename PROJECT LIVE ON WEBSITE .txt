Book Swap Application Documentation
Overview

The Book Swap Application is a Flask-based platform that enables users to share, borrow, and swap books. Admins have extra privileges to manage users, books, and swap requests. The app uses SQLAlchemy for database management and supports both SQLite (default) and MySQL.

Features

User Management: Create, update, delete users; assign books automatically; admin role support.

Book Management: Add, update, assign, return, and delete books; track availability.

Swap Requests: Users can request swaps, accept/reject them; admins can view all requests.

Admin Tools: Protected by an ADMIN_TOKEN, allowing full control over users, books, and swaps.
